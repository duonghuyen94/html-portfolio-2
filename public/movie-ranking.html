<h1>The best movies in my opinion</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The shining</h3>
<p>I love horror movies with bizarre visual and some craziness.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal animals</h3>
<p>Super stylish and fashionable. But full of humanity.</p>
<h3>One cut of the dead</h3>
<p>You can never predict the 2nd half of the film. So hilarious, yet so real and heartfelt.</p>
